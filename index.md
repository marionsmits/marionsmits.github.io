Marion Smits is full professor, Chief of neuroradiology, and Co-Chair of the neuroradiology fellowship programme at Erasmus MC - University Medical Centre Rotterdam (NL). 
She also holds an honorary appointment at the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London (UK). She combines  research with clinical work as a neuro- and head & neck radiologist, with a particular focus on neuro-oncology in the [Brain Tumour Centre](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/hersentumorcentrum/) of the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam (NL). 
She is Past-President of the [European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology (ESMRMB)](https://www.esmrmb.org), Chair of the Publications Committee and Executive Council member at the [European Society of Radiology](myesr.org), Past-Chair of the Imaging Group and Chair of the Brain Tumour Group Imaging Committee of the [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)](http://www.eortc.org).

Marion is principal investigator of Applied Physiological Neuroimaging. This research line is focused on the non-invasive, <i>in vivo</i> visualisation of the human brainâ€™s function and (micro)structure under physiological and particularly pathological conditions. She held her inaugural lecture entitled ['The Image that Counts'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuPW2FBd6p0&t=19s) on 14 June 2019. She is a strong supporter of open science, such as open access publication of all output as well as sharing research data for further use. Publication of the 'Erasmus MC Glioma Database' (EGD), which includes imaging data as well as genetic status of over 1,500 glioma patients, is imminent. This database formed the basis for the [largest study to date of predicting glioma genotype and grade using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04425.pdf).

She is dedicated to breaking down the boundaries between the research arena and clinical practice and vice versa, by disseminating knowledge and insight gained from her research and by clinical implementation of physiological MR neuroimaging through her numerous teaching activities and leadership positions. Marion is permanent faculty of the European School of MRI and the European Course of Neuroradiology, and a frequent lecturer at international congresses such as ECR, RSNA, and ESNR. She organised numerous courses on advanced neuroimaging. 

She was Visiting Professor at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution - Department of Neuroradiology in 2015, and gave the 20th annual Henry M. Selby, MD, FACR Young Investigators Lecture at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 2018. In 2020, she was awarded the honorary membership of the American Society of Neuroradiology in recognition of her extraordinary contributions to the field of neuroradiology.
