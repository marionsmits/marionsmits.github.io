Marion is principal investigator of Applied Physiological Neuroimaging. This research line is focused on the non-invasive, in vivo visualisation of the human brain’s function and (micro)structure under physiological and particularly pathological conditions. The clinical applicability and implementation of functional MR neuroimaging techniques and their findings are an important aspect of her research line. This means that she closely collaborates, both nationally and internationally, with a variety of clinicians such as neurologists, neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, rehabilitation physicians, (neuro)psychologists, and psychiatrists.  
Her research group consists of 3 post-doctoral researchers, 6 PhD students, and a variable number of MSc students and research fellows.  
She has a key position in several international research organisations, including the European Society of Radiology (ESR), the European Society of Neuroadiology (ESNR), the ESMRMB, the EORTC, the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), and the National Brain Tumor Society (NBTS). She uses this unique combination of affiliations to establish productive connections between relevant clinical research questions and to implement scientific innovation in clinical practice, while disseminating knowledge and expertise through her numerous national and international teaching activities.
