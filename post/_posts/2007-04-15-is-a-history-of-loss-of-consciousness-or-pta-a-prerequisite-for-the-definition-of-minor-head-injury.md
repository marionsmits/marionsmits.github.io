Well, we think it isn'tâ€¦ We studied known risk factors for neurocranial complications after minor head injury both in patients with and in patients without a history of loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). Neurocranial complications were seen in both groups, sometimes even requiring neurosurgical intervention, and risk factors were found to be homogeneous across the two patient groups. The paper presenting these results has today been accepted for publication in [JNNP](http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/rapidpdf/jnnp.2007.117143v1), and should be available online through their fast-track system in 10 days' time!
