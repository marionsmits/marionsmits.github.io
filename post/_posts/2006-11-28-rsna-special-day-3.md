More neuro-traumaimaging today: Dr. Gellella presented results from DTI imaging in minor head injury patients - one year post-injury. Even though these patients had very minor trauma, and no abnormalities on conventional imaging, FA changes were seen in the splenium of the corpus callosum and in the internal capsule, on a group level. Particularly interesting and promising, since I also acquire DTI data in my minor head injury patients; can't wait to analyse!



I presented my first fMRI results of working memory related brain activation changes in minor head injury patients today. I am really happy with these first results, and fortunately the audience seemed interested too!
