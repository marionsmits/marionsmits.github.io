Completely unrelated to RSNA, although it was pointed out to me here and it is related to Radiology, I found out today that our [CHIP prediction rule](http://hilton.org.uk/chip-prediction-rule/) - to predict intracranial complications after minor head injury - is included in the [MediMath app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/medimath-medical-calculator/id289039914?mt=8) for iPhone and iPad! It is only 3 years ago that the reviewers for [our paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17371884) commented that the CHIP prediction rule may be too complicated for clinical practice, which is why we also included a simple list of risk factors for clinical use. This simplification leads to a slightly worse performance of the rule, so I'm really chuffed that the more complex rule can now also be used easily. If I hadn't found myself a justification for buying an iPhone, I definitely have found it now ;-).
