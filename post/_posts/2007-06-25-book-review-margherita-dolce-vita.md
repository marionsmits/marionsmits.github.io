[ ![Margherita Dolce Vita](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3579694/marionsmits.net/2007/06/margherita_dolce_vita.thumbnail.jpg) ](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Margherita-Dolce-Vita-Stefano-Benni/dp/1933372206)

This book (S. Benni) about Margherita, a 14 1/2 year old, somewhat overweight girl with a passion for writing "bad poetry" and "the start of books", is very funny and beautifully magical. The story easily takes you from a walk in the meadow to a wander into someone else's dreams, Margherita's class mates being just as real as the ghost of the "Dust girl". An easy and very entertaining read, definitely recommended.
