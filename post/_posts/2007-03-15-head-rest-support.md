We've really been struggling with the chunky headphones and the tight 8-channel head coil, both on our 3T and 1.5T GE MR systems. Basically, people with even a normal sized head just don't fit (comfortably) within the head rest when wearing the headphones, needed for stimulus presentation during fMRI experiments.

So I was very happy when our new eye tracking system came with a new head rest, that is shaped such that headphones fit perfectly. It is available from [ Avotec](http://www.avotec.org), product no. 745420, for $350 + shipping. Of course, you can also just try to reshape your original headrest, but personally, I am not that good with the jigsaw...
