Monique Bernsen, myself and Aad van der Lugt at [ESMRMB 2006](http://www.esmrmb.org/), where I presented "Fusion of fMRI and Diffusion Tensor: practical applications" during the lunch symposium organised by GE Healthcare.

Due to very, very poor time management, I spent all my time in Warsaw preparing my presentation - in my hotel room - and missed the opportunity of visiting the city :-(. The excellent coffee bar that I had breakfast at, however, seems plenty of reason to visit Warsaw again - properly.
