I've finally descended from my pink cloud after receiving my PhD with distinction (!) last week and put some pictures online from the [defence](http://www.pbase.com/marion_smits/the_defence), [dinner](http://www.pbase.com/marion_smits/dinner), and [party](http://www.pbase.com/marion_smits/phd_party) (a slightly censored selection - don't worry..). Some more party pics can be found on [Egor's site](http://gallery.mac.com/dutchcelt#100109&bgcolor=black&view=grid) for which I deny all responsibility...
