First day at RSNA, and again, although it's my 4th time here, overwhelmed by the scale of thingsâ€¦

I almost instantly walk into a large photo of one of my colleagues (Sandra van Tiel): she's one of the molecular imaging awardees!

Scientific session on neuroimaging in dementia was disappointing, with 2 speakers not having shown up and 1 further presentation not having been uploaded. The trauma-imaging session included a talk by dr. Rosenkrantz (Baltimore) on whole brain and regional DTI changes in correlation with GCS scores - interestingly, ADC changes in head injury patients compared to controls are seen throughout the brain, and don't seem to be region-specific.
