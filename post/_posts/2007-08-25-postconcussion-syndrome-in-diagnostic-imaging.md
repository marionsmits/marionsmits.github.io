Although none of my friends, colleagues or even co-authors were able to make it to my presentation (with feeble excuses, like "I was still having lunch") on postconcussion syndrome at ISMRM in Berlin this year, a reporter from Diagnostic Imaging *did* come to listen! His report can be found in this recently published[ Diagnostic Imaging Conference Special](http://www.dimag.com/techfocus/ismrm/2007/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=HUWDNZ0Y034HWQSNDLQCKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=201202721).
