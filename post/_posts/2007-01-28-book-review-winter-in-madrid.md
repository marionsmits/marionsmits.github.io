Winter in Madrid (C.J. Sansom) is a historical spy thriller, set in Madrid during World War II against the background of the Spanish Civil war. I have to admit that I don't know much about that part of modern history, but apparently the book is overall historically correct. The characters, mostly English and all with their own reasons for being in Madrid, are very well described and it is therefore very easy to be dragged into their complicated and tragic lives. Once started, this book wasn't easy to put down, with its almost cinematographic writing. Much recommended, but no happy endings, alas..
