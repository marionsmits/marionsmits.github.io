A disappointing day for Erasmus MC today... unlike previous years, not one poster prize or invitation to publish in RadioGraphics this time :-(. Well, at least our posters did not get lost in shipment. Others weren't so luckyâ€¦

The poster on the history of evidence based medicine from - where else - Greece received an invitation to publish in RadioGraphics.

One to keep an eye on, if the paper's just as interesting as the poster design!
