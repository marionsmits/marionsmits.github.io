In the past year, I have often wondered why I do this: combining a fulltime clinical job with (PhD) research.. Today, it is obvious. I am in Vienna, for the European Congress of Radiology (ECR), and it is just worth all those evenings working late, lack of sleep and poor social life.

ECR's scheduling of the scientific sessions this year is a bit peculiar: while my colleague presented on carotid calcifications in a session on peripheral nerve and muscle disease, I got to present the findings on our cost-effectiveness analysis of CT scanning in minor head injury in the CTA session. Fortunately, Aunt Minnie was present and wrote a long[ article](http://www.auntminnie.com/index.asp?Sec=rca&Sub=ecr_2008&Pag=dis&ItemId=80326) on my talk!

Lots of talks on dual source/dual energy CT this year. The way to go for CTA of the brain?
