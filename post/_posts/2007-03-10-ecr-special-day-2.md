Very busy day today: presenting "Loss of consciousness in minor head injury" from our CHIP study, my fMRI study of postconcussion syndrome, and "Neuro-applications at 3T" at the GE Healthcare Satellite symposium. Not much time and energy left to follow many other talks or courses..

Still, it was great to hear Dr. Nyhsen present her results from a "mini CHIP study" from Newcastle upon Tyne. Newcastle's the 2nd most popular place for clubbing - after London - apparently, which provides the Newcastle A&E departments with an abundance of minor head injury patients. Their patients' characteristics seem to bear a striking resemblance with our Rotterdam population: young, intoxicated men... Fallen Over Pissed (FOP). Anyway, the use of CT in minor head injury remains a topic of much debate, and many questions were asked regarding CT reduction, radiation issues, and cost-effectiveness... all to be addressed in my next CHIP paper!
