The CHIP (<strong>C</strong>T in <strong>H</strong>ead <strong>I</strong>njury <strong>P</strong>atients) study is our multicentre observational study of risk factors in minor head injury patients. We collected data on >3,000 patients during a 2.5 year period in four university hospitals in the Netherlands.



We developed the CHIP prediction rule to identify patients at risk of intracranial complications after minor head injury, that would benefit from CT scanning in the acute setting. The CHIP prediction rule will be published in *Annals of Internal Medicine* on March 20th.
