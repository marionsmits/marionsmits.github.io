In true Bridget Jones style and putting Stephen Covey's Seven Habits into practice, here's my 2007 personal mission statement: I will buy a house, finish my PhD *and* will not get overworked. How? Well, I will:




1. finish reading the Seven Habits (still stuck at habit no. 5).

1. wait for a miracle to happen (hopefully described in habits 6-7).

1. failing the above, go to the gym and get in superhuman shape.

1. write a bunch of papers, stumble upon the house of our dreams, get a mortgage and be happy.




Now, that doesn't seem too hard, does it? Happy New Year!
