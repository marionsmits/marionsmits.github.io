Last week I organised the fMRI and DTI Hands-On Course on behalf of the [European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology](http://www.esmrmb.org/) (ESMRMB) in Rotterdam. It was fun, but, man, I really wasn't prepared for the immense amount of energy this would take.

Mind you, the course was a success, due to the efforts of the excellent speakers and practical assistants. I really do hope that the participants realised how amazing it is to be able to listen to both Stefan Sunaert and Derek Jones on the same course - some of the best speakers in their field - and have so many highly expert faculty members around for 3 days to guide them through the basics of fMRI and DTI acquisition and data analysis.

This year was the first year for ESMRMB to organise these so-called hands-on courses, while already having a long-standing successful MRI teaching programme in the form of the School of MRI. The hands-on courses are specifically aimed at radiographers/technicians, but it seems there is also a need for hands-on courses among radiologists, physicists and PhD students, who also attended the course in Rotterdam and were equally enthusiastic.

I do realise now why hands-on courses are so scarce and I have gained a huge respect for those organising such very practical courses (such as the [FSL](http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/index.html) course). Not only because it's such an awful lot of work, but also because there are so incredibly many things that can go wrong, which are entirely beyond your control - not at all compatible with my personality type!

But, it *was* fun, and the social programme... priceless ;-)
