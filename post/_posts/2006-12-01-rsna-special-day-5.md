Last day of the conference, and many people have already left; very happy to have escaped the snow storm today, no doubt. Some, on the other hand, are stranded.. So, Meike's talk this morning, the 2 but last presentation of the conference, luckily still has a bit of an audience. I felt really brave wandering through the snow and wind this morning, but also a bit worried about my flight this afternoon..
