With our hospital being an ever-changing building site, it may be tricky to find your way to the site of my PhD defence, so here's some directions:

1. Take entrance 3 "Sophia/Faculteit" (see map below)
2. Take the elevator to floor 3
3. Follow signs to "Faculteitsgebouw" (over a bridge)
4. Look for (and follow!) red signs "Promotie" or "Collegezaal 7"

If you get lost, ring one of my "paranimfs"

Please note that the estimated walking time from the entrance to the defence is 10 mins (and that the defence starts 1.45pm sharp).
