A very hazy start of the day - I hadn't quite realised that the bars in the Bermuda triangle don't actually close... and that you can really never find your way out...

A brilliant talk on cost-effectiveness of CTA in the assessment of coronary artery disease by my PhD supervisor professor Hunink (no bias!). She manages to make it seem so easy (believe me: it's not!) and even has me interested in this part of the body so far removed from the brain. As far as the cost-effectiveness of me being here is concerned.. Huge quality of life and no expenses as others keep buying me drinks: Excellent!

And what a great end of the day: celebrating with cocktails having been awarded 3rd prize in the GE Brain Expert Competition!
