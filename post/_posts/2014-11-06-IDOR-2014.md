8 November, the day that in 1895 X-rays were officially discovered, is [International Day of Radiology](http://www.internationaldayofradiology.com). This year's theme is Neuroimaging. Our section of Neuroradiology at Erasmus MC starts celebrations early, on Friday 7 November, with a mini symposium on the **Past, Present and Future of Brain Imaging**. You are very welcome to join us in C-113, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam/NL, 5-6pm.  

Want a sneak preview? Here's a selection of my slides: [![slideshare-IDOR](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3579694/marionsmits.net/2014/title%20slide%20IDOR.png)](http://www.slideshare.net/MarionSmits/brain-imaging-now-and-in-the-future).
