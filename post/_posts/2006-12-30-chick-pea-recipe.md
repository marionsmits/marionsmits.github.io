One of my favourite Indian dishes, with many thanks to Mukund for showing us how to do it. Quantities by approximation.

1. Fry 1 green chili, 1 chopped onion and garlic until soft, and the onion caramelises.
1. Add ground cumin and coriander (1 tsp of each) and fry for another couple of minutes.
1. Add some chopped tomato, lemon juice, yoghurt (2 tbsp) and creamed coconut (1 tbsp).
1. Add chickpeas (1 tin).
1. Garnish with lots of fresh coriander and serve.
