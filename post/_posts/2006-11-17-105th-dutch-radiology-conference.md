This year's annual meeting of the [Dutch Radiological Society](http://www.radiologen.nl) was supposed to be "special" (the Society's 105th anniversary) and it was therefore held at the fairytale amusement park [De Efteling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efteling). I must admit, I wasn't that keen... forced to enjoy myself and all that. But, actually, it was great: I hadn't been to the park since I was a kid, and I was under its spell - again - straight away. Even the presentations seemed magical.

I presented "CT in head injury patients: the CHIP prediction rule for the use of CT in minor head injury" - the result of our multicenter study of the indications of CT in minor head injury.

And then, of course, there was the party...magical!
