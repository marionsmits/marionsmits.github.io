[![A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3579694/marionsmits.net/2007/05/short_history_tractors.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Short-History-Tractors-Ukrainian/dp/0141020520/)

A short history of tractors in Ukrainian (M. Lewycka) fortunately isn't in Ukrainian and only a little bit about tractors. It is the story of Ukrainian immigrants in the UK, past and present. Funny, lighthearted, and happy endings.. but also a gentle reminder of how lucky it is to be born in a country without economic or humanitarian suffering. Recommended.
