Our recently published [cost-effectiveness study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093524) on the use of CT in the assessment of patients with minor head injury has been added as [an abstract](http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=22010000547) to the NHS Economic Evaluation Database.

This publicly available database, covering studies in all languages published from 1994 onwards, contains structured abstracts of full economic evaluations. As well as a structured abstract, a critical appraisal of our study was made: "the study was well conducted (...) The authors' conclusions appear to be robust". Hurray!
