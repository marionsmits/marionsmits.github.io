[![Interpretation of Murder](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3579694/marionsmits.net/2007/10/interpretation_murder.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Interpretation-Murder-Jed-Rubenfeld/dp/0755331427)

The interpretation of Murder (J. Rubenfeld) is a good old murder mystery set in Manhattan of 1909 at the time of Freud's only visit to the States. An easy and enjoyable read, with a nice twist at the end. For the obsessive amongst us, there's a whole section on historical (in)correctness at the end, and even a link for posting any mistakes that you may have encountered. As if I care.. Recommended for a rainy afternoon.
