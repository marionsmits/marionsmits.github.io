Our review paper on the white matter tracts of speech and language is now [available online](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887217114000663), and free to download for a limited period. The paper appears in a special issue of Seminars in Ultrasound, CT and MRI on Brain white matter tracts, edited by Adam Thomas. 

In this paper we describe the normal anatomy of the major language white matter tracts, namely the arcuate fasciculus, the uncinate fasciculus and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. We provide a detailed description of seed and target region of interest placement for fibre tracking. Clinically, fibre tracking of these tracts is primarily performed for presurgical evaluation of brain tumour patients. From a clinical research perspective, the white matter language tracts are of interest in cerebrovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease.
