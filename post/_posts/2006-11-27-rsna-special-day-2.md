Trauma-imaging again this morning: professor Alisa Gean (San Francisco) gave a very comprehensive overview of neuro-imaging of trauma. Very nice to hear that she's using "the Rotterdam score", developed by our own Neurosurgery department ([Neurosurgery 2005;57:1173-82](http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2005&issue=12000&article=00013&type=abstract)), for predicting mortality based on certain CT criteria on a routine basis.
