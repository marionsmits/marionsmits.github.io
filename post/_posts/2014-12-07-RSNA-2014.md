At RSNA last week I gave a lecture on non-traumatic CNS emergencies, as part of the joint ESR-RSNA symposium on Radiological emergencies. Prof. Howard Rowley covered the traumatic CNS emergencies in the same session. We had a full house, 450 participants in the lecture theatre. In addition, 400 people attended the session virtually. 

If you missed it, or would like to see it again, you have until 19 December to attend RSNA's [virtual meeting](http://www.rsna.org/Virtual/). And if you want to have the real-life experience: come and see us at ECR 2015.
