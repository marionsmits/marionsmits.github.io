Tomorrow is going to be my first day as a consultant Radiologist. Remember those first days? Of school? University? New job? I do.. scary as hell. Plunge in the deep end, eyes closed. So, tomorrow I'll have another one. My new life, working without the safety net of a supervisor, no-one to ask for advice anymore, huge responsibilities. Terrifying.

On the other hand, today is the last day of my eight-year Radiology specialisation! Final day of those nagging supervisors, shitty jobs, dreadful night shifts... hurray!

So, glass half-full or half-empty? Nah, filled to the brim and I just worry a bit too much sometimes... nothing that a large G&T can't fix :-).

(not that I'm suggesting alcohol is a solution, mind)
