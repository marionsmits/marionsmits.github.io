What an excellent end of the year... last week I was granted a research fellowship by Erasmus University Rotterdam which will allow me to do research for the next four years! Read all about it on [the Erasmus University web site](http://www.eur.nl/nieuws/detail/article/8524/) (in Dutch).

I will be moving away from head injury and enter the exciting (oh, and very hot and trendy) field of dementia. This may seem like a big step, but really, it's neurocognition, fMRI and DTI.. nothing new, just patients with cognitive disorders without having hit their head first.

So lots of money for more research time and less clinical work! Oh, and did I mention the huge mortgage for the [most beautiful house in Rotterdam](http://www.funda.nl/WoningAanbod/Koop/Detail/Fotos/?id=237c43f2-a663-4a2a-9786-fb193c1fed14&objecttype=DetailKoopObject) we just bought? ;-)
