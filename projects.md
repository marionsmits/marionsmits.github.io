<br><b>[Advanced imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) in neuro-oncology](https://hersentumorcentrum.nl/wetenschap-en-onderzoek/beeldvormende-diagnostiek/)</b>
<br><i>Role:</i> principal investigator
<br>This research line comprises multiple projects at Erasmus MC (some in collaboration with LUMC, TU Delft, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Radboudumc Nijmegen, AmsterdamUMC) aimed at the development and implementation of novel imaging and image analysis techniques of brain tumours. The work is a result of close collaboration with the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (BIGR) led by prof. Stefan Klein, the MRI physics group led by prof. Juan Hernandez-Tamames, and clinical partners within the Brain Tumour Centre of the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute (Neuro-oncology, Neurosurgery, Neuropathology, Radiation therapy). Together we assess imaging phenotypes of glioma genotypes by developing AI (iGENE & iGENE2.0 study, vascular signature mapping), and develop and validate advanced imaging techniques such as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging and combined PET-MRI imaging. Clinical translation and utility are important aspects of both AI and advanced image acquisition assessment.

<br><b>[PERISCOPE](https://zorgevaluatienederland.nl/evaluations/periscope): the clinical value of perfusion MRI in primary and secondary brain tumour surveillance</b>
<br><i>Role:</i> principal investigator
<br>In this Dutch nation-wide multicentre study data are collected both prospectively and retrospectively on brain tumour patient aiming to assess the clinical value of perfusion MRI in their management. Fifteen centres are currently involved, and data of over 1,000 patients have thus far been collected. 
<br><i>Funding:</i> ZonMW Leading the Change
<br><i>Core researchers involved:</i> Assoc. Prof. Anouk van der Hoorn (UMCG), Asst. Prof. Brenda Leeneman (EUR), Seamus Kent (PhD student), Dr. Wouter Teunissen.

<br><b>Sustainable neuro-imaging in oncology</b>
<br><i>Role:</i> principal and co-investigator
<br><i>Funding:</i> TKI-LSH
<br>The use of contrast-agents is commonplace in imaging for neuro-oncology, but environmental concerns together with the advancement of imaging techniques require a re-assessment of current practices. We investigate whether follow-up of untreated meningeoma can be performed without contrast-agent administration and what the value of contrast-agent administration is in long-term survivors of glioma. Additionally, we investigate new MRI techniques for their potential to replace contrast-enhanced techniques.

<br><b>[Cancer Diagnostics 3.0: big data science of <i>in</i> & <i>ex vivo</i> imaging](https://www.medicaldelta.nl/en/research/cancer-diagnostics-3-0-big-data-science-of-in-ex-vivo-imaging)</b>
<br><i>Role:</i> scientific lead
<br>This is one of thirteen scientific programmes within the medical-technological research environment of the 'Medical Delta'. The ultimate aim is to provide cancer diagnosis without the need for invasive procedures such as biopsy through advanced imaging and image analysis techniques. The current focus is on brain tumours.
<br><i>Funding:</i> Medical Delta, NWO-TTW
<br><i>Core researchers involved:</i> Prof. Matthias van Osch (LUMC, co-lead), Assoc. Prof. Jeroen Kalkman (TU Delft, co-lead), Karin van Garderen (Erasmus MC, PhD student), Barbara Schmitz-Abecassis (LUMC, PhD student), Alim Yolalmaz (TU Delft, post-doc)

<br><b>[GLASS-NL: Glioma Longitudinal AnalySiS in the Netherlands](https://www.glass-consortium.org)</b>
<br><i>Role:</i> work package lead (imaging)
<br>GLASS-NL constitutes the Dutch section of the global [GLASS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29432615/) consortium which comprises a multidisciplinary group of glioma researchers aiming to understand glioma tumour evolution and expose therapeutic vulnerabilities. First results on longitudinal trajectories of diffuse glioma were recently [published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1775-1). The Dutch section focuses on IDH mutant astrocytoma, and imaging is used to determine radiogenomic tumour features longitudinally, with a view to non-invasively diagnose changes in tumour genetics allowing for early and targeted therapeutic intervention.
